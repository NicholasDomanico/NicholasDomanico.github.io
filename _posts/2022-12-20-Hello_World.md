title:  "Hello, World!"
---

My name is Nicholas Domanico. I’m a cybersecurity student, Linux user, animal lover, and Christian.

The main reason I am writing this blog is not only for enjoyment, or just because I like computers, but for learning. I have always found that writing things down has always helped me to retain information and understand how things work. My hope for this blog is that it will be a way not only for me to learn, but that it may also be of use to others who have an interest in computer networking, whether for their career or otherwise.

Throughout this blog, I’ll discuss a variety of subjects, focusing on networking, as well as building and maintaining a homelab. A homelab is an excellent way to gain hands on experience working with technology like routers, firewalls, and servers, and I’ll be discussing projects I work on in my homelab, such as working with security technologies, network segmentations, remote access, and other topics.

I hope you enjoy this blog!
