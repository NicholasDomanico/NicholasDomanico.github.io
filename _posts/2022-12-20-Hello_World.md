Hello, World!

My name is Nicholas Domanico. I’m a cybersecurity student, Linux user, animal lover, and Christian.

I have always been a bit of a geek. I built my first computer when I was thirteen. While I was in high school I got my hands on a Raspberry Pi, which I used to learn Linux, as well as some Python and networking skills. Ever since then I have been continuously learning. My most recent projects have been in my homelab. I will be writing more about this, but for now, you can learn more about homelabbing at /r/homelab. 

The main reason I am writing this blog is not only for enjoyment, or just because I like computers, but for learning. I have always found that writing things down has always helped me to retain information and understand how things work. My hope for this blog is that it will be a way not only for me to learn, but that it may also be of use to others who have an interest in computer networking, whether for their career or otherwise.

Throughout this blog, I’ll discuss a variety of subjects, focusing on networking, as well as building and maintaining a homelab. A homelab is an excellent way to gain hands on experience working with technology like routers, firewalls, and servers, and I’ll be discussing the various projects I work on in mine, such as working with security technologies, network segmentations, remote access, and other topics. I will also veer into the subject of cybersecurity quite often, as this is a matter of great importance to me.

I hope you enjoy this blog!
