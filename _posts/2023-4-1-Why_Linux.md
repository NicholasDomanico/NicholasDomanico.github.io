title:  "Why Linux?"
---


To the average person, Linux may not seem like the best choice of operating systems. There are hundreds of distros that must be chosen from, each with its own benefits and quirks. Linux also has a steeper learning curve than the competitors. 


But yet, Linux runs the world.


Of the top 1 million web servers currently on the internet, a whopping 96.3 percent run Linux. https://www.zdnet.com/home-and-office/networking/can-the-internet-exist-without-linux/. 


All of the Top 500 most powerful supercomputers in the world run Linux https://www.stackscale.com/blog/most-powerful-supercomputers-linux/. 


Globally, 72.2 percent of smartphones are running Android, which is itself built on the Linux kernel.

And this is just a sampling. Smart devices, home routers, enterprise grade security equipment, and CERN’s Large Hadron Collider, all run Linux. Why is Linux so widely used?

### History of Linux

Let's start with some history. In 1969 Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, and several others working at AT&T Bell Labs developed an operating system for their mainframe computers. This OS came to be called Unix. Bell labs continued to develop Unix, but due to a 1956 antitrust case, AT&T was not legally able to commercialize computer products, so they licensed Unix source code to anyone who asked. This led to Unix being used in colleges around the world, especially in computer science classes. It also led to a wide variety of Unix variations developed by different people. Companies and universities would build on the Unix source code to develop their own “flavors” of Unix. For example, students and the University of California Berkeley used Unix as the basis for the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD), an ancestor of the still widely used FreeBSD. 


Everything seemed to be working out well. A simple but powerful operating system available to anyone who had the skill to work with it, being ported to various computer architectures. This computing nirvana was hindered however in 1983, when the restrictions on AT&T forbidding them from commercializing computer products was lifted. They promptly released Unix System V, with much stricter licensing requirements, stifling the free exchange of source code. 


Linux was created in 1991 by a Finnish computer science student named Linus Torvalds, who was unhappy with the operating systems available to him, and wanted an operating system which was free and open source, without the restrictive licensing of Unix System V. He based his operating system on Unix, and thus it is considered “Unix-Like”, however, there is no Unix components in the Linux source code.


Linus Torvalds released the Linux kernel source code to the public free of charge. Throughout the 90s, development of Linux exploded. Students, companies, and even government agencies began using and contributing to Linux. Linux was stable, fast, and could be customized without concern for licensing. Various versions of Linux, called distributions, were created, all based on the same Linux kernel, but with various differences such as included utilities or user interfaces.


### Benefits of open source software


This is one of the reasons why Linux is so popular even today. Open source software such as Linux is free, but not just free as in financially, but users are free to do with the Linux source code as they please. Due to a lack of license restrictions, users are allowed to customize the Linux to match their needs, such as running on a specific processor architecture, or running on a certain type of devices such as routers or smartphones. Whether you are a hobbyist or NASA, Linux could be customized to fit your needs. This stands opposed to proprietary, closed source operating systems such as Windows, macOS, and others. The source code cannot be altered legally by the users. You can't just stick Windows in a smart watch. You can with Linux, at least if you have the programming skill to implement it.


This is why Google used Linux as the base for the Android operating system, which powers a majority of smartphones around the world today. Linux has also been used to power routers, microcontrollers, smart devices, and all manner of devices because of this development model. Why develop your own operating system from scratch, or use a proprietary operating system like Windows, when a fully customizable OS is available to you at no cost?


Cost is another major consideration, and is why Linux is frequently used in corporate environments. Companies like Microsoft charge (often herty) licensing fees for businesses to use Windows in their business or data center environments. Linux provides businesses with a scalable solution which they can use without licensing restrictions.


### Security benefits.


Another major advantage of open source software, and Linux in particular, is that open source software is often more secure than closed source. This may seem counterintuitive, but it is absolutely true.


With most proprietary software, the source code is a guarded secret made available only to a team of developers who work at the company. The internals of the software are “locked” from the public's view. This is not so with open source software. When software is open source, it is available to scrutiny by whatever developers choose to analyze it. The end result is that there are more eyeballs scouring the code for bugs and security holes that can make the software vulnerable. When open source projects like Linux are hosted online, other developers can submit bug reports when they find flaws in the code, or even contribute a bug fix themselves.




### Conclusion


Linux hasan extremely wide array of uses, especially when compared to proprietary operating systems, and this is due mostly to its being free, lacking licensing restrictions, and open source development model. This open source development model has also increased Linux’s stability and security, and made it possible for Linux to be conformed to various circumstances.
